# üå∏ FumoFumo Reimagined! 
üîÆ Welcome to "FumoFumo Reimagined" github page!

This mod introduces a variety of Fumo Dolls as collectible items, each representing a unique Touhou character. These Fumo Dolls possess special abilities and powers that correspond to the lore of their respective characters, which will be activated during specific events.

# ‚ö° Important Note: Early Development Stage
 
Please note that the "FumoFumo Reimagined" mod is currently in its early stages of development. At this point, the mod only includes a limited selection of Fumo Dolls and related items. However, we assure you that we are actively working on expanding the mod content and features.

# üõ†Ô∏è Setup Process 
1. Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file. 
2. Open IDEA, and import project. 
3. Select your build.gradle file and have it import. 
4. Run the following command: `gradlew genIntellijRuns` (`./gradlew genIntellijRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux) 
5. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything {this does not affect your code} and then start the process again.

# üî• TO-DO
Remember once again, the mod is at the earliest stage of development, and at this stage the repository was made for convenience. We actively working on this project, and have some plans on moving on:

- [ ] Add all fumos from Touhou Project
- [ ] Functionality to fumos, that corresponding to the characters
- [ ] Create an upgrade system for fumos ability
- [ ] Skin system for fumo customisation
- [ ] Add non-touhou fumos
